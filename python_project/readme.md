# A Python Coffee Shop

## Abstract

As an aspiring DevOps engineer I have been on a journey to learn a wide range of new technologies. This portfolio, and this project in particular, I am maintaining to demonstrate the evolution my skills.

### Introduction

At the start of 2025 I was a complete beginner, but after enrolling in an intensive, 12 week, full-time, bootcamp with [Generation UK&I](https://uk.generation.org/), I was tasked with learning Python. The process was not the old fashioned talk-n-chalk approach, it was primarily hands-on practical challenges, which required me to develop and improve my research skills, as well as embrace AI LLMs, to facilitate my productivity - **But not to replace my understanding of concepts!**

At the culmination of our Python module we were given an assignment to model a coffee shop in Python, with a range of client requirements:

#### Essentials
- An easy to navigate user interface
- Display a list of the menu and book items
- Allow customers to order food, drinks, and books
- Allow customers to view additional details about products
- Allow customers to review their order
- Allow employees to apply promotional discounts

#### Stretch Goals
- Allow employees to add new menu/book items.
- Allow employees to update stock items.
- Allow customers to order books for delivery
- Add access control to employee functions

#### 'Blue Sky' wishes
The client would like to have a customer sign-up program for their regulars, once the customers details have been saved the customer should be able to:
- Order books for delivery more quickly as their details are aleady on record.
- Receive a loyalty discount for every 10 purchases.
- The customer records should be accesible to employees only.
